## Inspiration and Knowledge Sources

The ModularAspireFramework template has been created with knowledge gained from various sources. Special acknowledgement goes to:

### Milan Jovanović

This template is significantly influenced by Milan Jovanović's teachings and courses on modular monolith architecture, clean architecture principles, and modern .NET development patterns. Many of the architectural decisions and implementation approaches in this template are based on concepts learned from Milan's work.

### Links to Milan's Resources

This template is specifically inspired by Milan's comprehensive course:
- [Modular Monolith Architecture Course](https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/modular-monolith-architecture) - An in-depth course that teaches how to build maintainable and scalable applications using modular monolith architecture.

If you're interested in learning more about these architectural approaches, we recommend checking out Milan's courses and resources.
